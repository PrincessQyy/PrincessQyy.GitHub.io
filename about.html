<br>Forced expiratory alive even love bone might</br>
<br>Don't beg anyone satisfied as long as you live up to his</br>
<br>About ideal I never choose to give up</br>
<br>Even in the dusty day</br>
<br>Maybe I don't have the talent</br>
<br>But I dream of innocence</br>
<br>I will go to prove with my life</br>
<br>Run forward</br>
<br>Meet cool detachment and laugh at</br>
<br>The vast without hardships can feel of life</br>
<br>It can't destiny to let us kneel for mercy</br>
<br>Even if the blood with the arms</br>
<br>Continue to run</br>
<br>With the pride of the champ</br>
<br>Sparkle of life is not how can stick to it</br>
<br>It is better to live than to alive combustion</br>
<br>One day will sprout</br>
